# Multicast Client

Java-based networking project demonstrating multicast communication.

The **Multicast Client** connects to a multicast group (`230.0.0.111`) on port `1111` and listens for incoming datagram packets. The program receives and displays simulated stock data transmitted over the network.

### Features

* Uses Javaâ€™s `MulticastSocket` for group communication.
* Joins a multicast group and receives multiple messages in real time.
* Demonstrates network programming concepts including datagram packets and group membership.
* Leaves the group and closes the socket gracefully after completion.

This project highlights knowledge of **Java networking, sockets, and multicast communication protocols**.
